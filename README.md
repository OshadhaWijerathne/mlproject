## End to End Machine Learning Project

# Student Performance Predictor 

This project showcases a **complete, end-to-end machine learning pipeline** designed to **predict student academic performance**. From raw data to actionable insights, this repository demonstrates key stages of an ML project:

---

## Project Stages

-   **Data Ingestion**: Efficiently collecting and preparing the raw dataset.
-   **Data Transformation**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data to prepare it for model training.
-   **Model Training**: Building and evaluating various machine learning models to find the best fit for predicting student scores.
-   **Model Deployment**: Exposing the trained model through a **Flask web application**, allowing users to input data and get real-time predictions.
